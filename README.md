### My name is Kurtis! 
I'm an artist with an interest in web development and game design. My main passion is video games and I wish to work as a production artist for a game company either in a freelance or as a full time inhouse artist. I hope one day to be able to design my own worlds and games at either my own game studio or my own art studio. Until then, I am working as a teacher's assistant at CodeWorks in Boise! I hope to use the skills I learn to get experience working in the technology field so I can translate that into my own future ambitions. 

Thanks for stopping by!
